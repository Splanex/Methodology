We'll abuse utilman.exe to escalate privileges this time. Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen

Since Utilman is run with SYSTEM privileges, we will effectively gain SYSTEM privileges if we replace the original binary for any payload we like. As we can take ownership of any file, replacing it is trivial.

To replace utilman, we will start by taking ownership of it with the following command:

	takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe

Notice that being the owner of a file doesn't necessarily mean that you have privileges over it, but being the owner you can assign yourself any privileges you need. To give your user full permissions over utilman.exe you can use the following command:

	icacls C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe /grant [Controlled User]:F

After this, we will replace utilman.exe with a copy of cmd.exe:

	copy C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe
