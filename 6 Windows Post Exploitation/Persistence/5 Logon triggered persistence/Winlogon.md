Another alternative to automatically start programs on logon is abusing Winlogon, the Windows component that loads your user profile right after authentication (amongst other things).

Winlogon uses some registry keys under HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon that could be interesting to gain persistence

- Userinit points to userinit.exe, which is in charge of restoring your user profile preferences.
- shell points to the system's shell, which is usually explorer.exe.

**Registry**: HKLM \\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon

Append to **Userinit** or to **shell** the path to the malicious executable
