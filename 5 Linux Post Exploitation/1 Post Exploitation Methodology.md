Some of the actions you can take in an open session include:

- Collect System Information (Run script or manual find)
- Pivot
- Run Meterpreter Modules
- Search the File System

### Linux Privilege Escalation Checklist

- Kernel Exploit (Use script)
- Exploiting services which are running as root `netstat -antup` and `ps -aux | grep root`
- Exploiting SUID Executables
- Exploiting SUDO rights/user
- Exploiting badly configured cron jobs
- Exploiting users with ‘.’ in their PATH
### Linux scripts

- LinPeas
- LinEnum
- LinuxPrivChecker
- Unix-privesc-check
### See Linux Post exploitation command line[](#see-linux-post-exploitation-command-line)

[[Linux Post Exploitation Command List]]

### Things to look for

- Miss-configured services (cronjobs)
- any running as a privileged user?
- Incorrect file permissions (exportfs, sudo)
- Miss-configured environment ($PATH)    
- Binary with SUID bit
- Software or OS with known vulnerabilities

### SUDO

Can you su to root without a password?

	su root

Are you a sudo user already? Do you have access to powerful commands like chown or chmod?

	sudo su -

Log in as another user''

	sudo -i -u <username>

### Grep hardcoded passwords

	grep -i user [filename]
	
	grep -i pass [filename]
	
	grep -C 5 "password" [filename]
	
	find . -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -i -n "var $password"
